I'll give you one good tiny reason
I think you could believe it
I'll give you one good tiny reason
I think you could see through it
I'm not the kind of man
That thinks the truth could hurt me
I'm not the kind of man
That thinks the truth can see me
You know a little bit goes a long way
And the time has come to undo the wrong I've done
I am a grieving man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a guilty man
And I can't believe the things I've done to you
I give you one good tiny reason
To push that big suit too far
I give you one good tiny reason
To smash him and his big car
Everybody thinks I'm blue
And what everybody thinks is true yeah
I just can't keep it inside
And so you think it's you
And so you think it's true
You know a little bit lasts a long time
And the time has come to undo the wrong I've done
And I am a grieving man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done to you, yeah you
And I am a blood soaked man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
And I am a guilty man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
And I am a grieving man
And I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
Some advantage in your vineyard now
I tried to pray, I tried to pray, I tried to pray
Yes I will give it a shot
Yes I will give it a shot
Yes I will give it a shot
