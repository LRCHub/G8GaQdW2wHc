In my heart
There is a panorama
There is a panorama, there is a panorama
Of you
Ooh...
Well I can't feel my face now
'Cause all the blood has down into my feet
And I can't even move a muscle
'Cause my limbs are superglued to this seat
A-ha, Oo-hu
But in the end I won't say a goddamned thing
'Cause you can prick me, poke me, punch me all you want
But you'll never, never get these word out of me
No.
Ah In my heart, there is a panorama (there is a panorama)
There is a panorama (there is a panorama)
There is a panorama (there is a panorama)
Of you
Ooh...
In my heart, there is a panorama (there is a panorama)
There is a panorama (there is a panorama)
There is a panorama (there is a panorama)
Of you
Ooh...
In my heart, (P) there is (A) a panorama (there is a panorama) (N)
(O) There is a panorama (R) (there is a panorama)
(A)There is a panorama (M) (there is a panorama)
Of you (A)
